# CS-250
This repository is a collection of works and artifacts produced from my CS-250 course which covered the various aspects of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

Reflection on pertinet section of this course:  

**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**  
User needs or requirements can be implemented as user stories. User stories reflect the requirements of the user in a way that can be understood and interpreted by developers. This, in turn, ensures that development is directly aligned with user needs.  

**How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**  

I believe that all program development should always be approched with the objective of the intended outcome. Intended outcomes should be the guiding principle to program development as it would ensure alignment with client objectives.  

Within the Agile development framework, there are a few staple practices that could definitely be incorporated in future development work. Sprint planning, for one, ensures that the team will have a solid plan to work on. Test-driven development helps to inject quality into the finished product. Continuous deployment ensures that the latest release of a product is of high quality - due to test-driven development and integration testing.  


**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**  
TO me, being a good team member means being responsible about the work allocated to me in the team, and being accountable to the team for that work. It also means taking the initiative to assist other team members, if I have the capacity or knowledge.
